what is Conditional Expressions ?

so if we're gonna answear this question before we should know little bit about comparing two variable 
for exemple we have 2 variable and we gonna compare them about a and b ; 
their value a = 1 , b = 5 
which one is greater a or b ?
a < b || true 
because 1<5 it's true 5 is greater than 1 that is why its true

a > b || false  || 5 is greater that 1 that is why its false
a != b || true || because they are not have same value that is why false
a == b || false || because they are not have same value for exemple when they have been same value it gives true
