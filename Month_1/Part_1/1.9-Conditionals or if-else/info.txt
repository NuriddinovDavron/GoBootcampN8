what is if Statements
The simplest form, checking a single condition and executing code if it's true.
Use syntax like this:


if age >= 18 {
  fmt.Println("You are eligible to vote!")
}


what is if-else Statements
Provide two sets of code, one for when the condition is true and one for when it's false.
Useful for handling opposite scenarios:


if score > 80 {
  fmt.Println("Congratulations! You passed with an A!")
} else {
  fmt.Println("Keep working hard! You can do better next time.")
}


what is switch Statements

More complex, checking a single value against multiple pre-defined cases.
Useful for handling different choices or states:

switch day := time.Now().Weekday() {
case wednesday, thursday:
  fmt.Println("Time for a mid-week boost!")
case saturday, sunday:
  fmt.Println("Enjoy your weekend!")
default:
  fmt.Println("Stay focused! Workday ahead.")
}
