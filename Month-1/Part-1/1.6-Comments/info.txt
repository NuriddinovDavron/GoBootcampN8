Why we need comments?
imagin you have a lot of code and you working with other coders that time other coders also should undersand your code how do you explain them ?
that time comments come to us to save our time and words we should just write comments for exemple // bla bla bla
it's not take a lot of time it demant just simple teach and write why are you using that and why is this need us? if you should answear these questions just write comments
it save your time and your don't have to explain other coders maybe it will be useful to you also becouse we are people and we are forgetable 
we don't know after month or year that why.
overall comments are necessary.
