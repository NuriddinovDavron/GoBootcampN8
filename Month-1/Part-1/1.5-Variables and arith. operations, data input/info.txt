Here's a comprehensive explanation of variables in Go, incorporating images where appropriate:

1. What are variables?

Variables are named containers that store values in memory.
They act as placeholders for data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program.
2. Declaration and initialization:

Using var keyword:
Go
var name string = "John"
var age int
Use code with caution. Learn more
Shorthand declaration (within functions):
Go
name := "Alice"
Use code with caution. Learn more


3. Types:
Go is statically typed, so variables must have a declared type.
Common types include:
int: Integers (e.g., 42, -15)
float64: Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5e-3)
string: Text strings (e.g., "Hello, world!")
bool: Boolean values (true or false)

4. Zero values:

Declared variables without explicit initialization are assigned their zero value:
0 for numbers
"" for strings
false for booleans
5. Naming conventions:

Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.
Start with a letter or underscore.
Can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
Use camelCase for multiple words (e.g., firstName, totalCount).
6. Scope:

Package-level scope: Declared outside of functions, accessible within the entire package.
Function-level scope: Declared within a function, accessible only within that function.
7. Visibility:

Variables declared with a lowercase letter are private to their package.
Variables declared with an uppercase letter are exported and accessible from other packages.
8. Assignment:

Use the = operator to assign values to variables.
Go
x = 10
greeting := "Hi there!"

9. Examples:

Go
// Package-level variables
var version string = "1.2.3"

func main() {
    // Function-level variables
    name := "Bob"
    age := 35

    fmt.Println("Hello,", name, "! You are", age, "years old.")
}


and we shouldn't use these word for name of variable
"   
    break, case, chan, const, continue, default, defer, else, 
    fallthrough, for, func, go, goto, if, import, interface, map,
    package, range, return, select, struct, switch, type, var
"
