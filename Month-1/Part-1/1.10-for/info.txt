what is for ?
"For" in Go is the single loop control structure used for iterating a block of code a specific number of times or based on a condition.

Here's a breakdown of the different forms of the "for" loop in Go:

1. Basic For Loop:
This form executes the loop a specific number of times defined by the initialization, condition, and post-statement:

for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
  // Code to be executed 5 times
  fmt.Println("Iteration", i)
}

2. For Loop with Initializer and Condition:

This form omits the post-statement, allowing you to update the iteration variable inside the loop body:

for i := 0; i < 10; {
  i++
  // Code to be executed based on i
  fmt.Println(i)
}
