Parallelism, multithreading and everything connected with it is a rather voluminous and complex topic.
Before moving on to concurrency in Go, you need to understand what threads and multithreading in general are.
Therefore, if this is your first time encountering this, we recommend that you first understand the basics of multithreading.
For example, read this article.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to come up with parallelism programming tasks in stepik due to the fact that this topic is difficult to check through input/output.
Practice on your own and try if you doubt anything. We will try to improve the lesson and add tasks if necessary (as elsewhere).
