What is Data type conversion ?
on our journey as a developer we encounter tasks that cannot be done without type conversion.
Convertions one type can have positive impact on both the ease of development and the performance of the application itself.
Or maybe you just need to call a function that only accepts a certain data type.

Let's talk about Golang in terms of types. It's a statically typed language;
to put it simply, data types in Go (and other statically typed languages) are associated with a variable, not its value. 
You have already learned that an int variable can only store integers. 
But Go allows you to convert between integer types, floating point numbers, strings, bytes, and so on.
