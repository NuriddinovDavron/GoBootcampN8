JSON
Understanding the JSON Format
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based structured data exchange format based on JavaScript.
JSON is not the only form available to us to solve this problem: 
XML, YAML and Google's Protocol Buffers serve a similar purpose, and each has its own niche, but due to its simplicity, readability and universal support, JSON is the most widely used.

JSON is one of two structures:
a set of key-value pairs;
an ordered set of values.
The following can be used as values in JSON:

an object is an unordered set of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces "{ }". 
The key is described by a string, with a “:” symbol between it and the value. Key-value pairs are separated by commas;
An array is an ordered set of values enclosed in square brackets "[ ]". Values are separated by commas;
number (integer or real);
literals true, false (boolean) and null;
line.
Let's look at an example of data in JSON format:

{
     "firstName": "Tom",
     "lastName": "Alonson",
     "address": {
         "streetAddress": "Phogtis highway, 101, apt. 101",
         "city": "Domma",
         "postalCode": 101101
     },
     "phoneNumbers": [
         "+1 123-1234",
         "+1 123-4567"
     ]
}
Here the data is a set of key-value pairs, with: firstName and lastName being strings, address being a nested set of key-value pairs, and phoneNumbers being an ordered set of values.
