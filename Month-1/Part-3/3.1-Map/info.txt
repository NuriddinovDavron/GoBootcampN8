What is map?
No no you have done mistake it's not like real map thing!
Map is a data structure a unsorted collection of key-value when we want add value we should give to it key too
Map in Go is a hash table and it's type is written map[K]{V} K = key , V = Value type of its keys and values.
All keys in a given mapping are of the same type, just as all values are of the same type, but the type of the of the keys doesn't
have to be the same type of the values.
The key should be compairable using the == operator so that the mapping can check whether a given key is equal to one of the keys in it.


var users map[string]int
// string - key, int - value

// using the built-in make function:
m1 := make(map[int]int)

// by using a mapping literal:
m2 := map[int]int{
    // Key:value pairs are specified as needed
    12:    2,
    1:     5,
}

fmt.Println(m1) // map[]
fmt.Println(m2) // map[1:5 12:2]
