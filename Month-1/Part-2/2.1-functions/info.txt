what is functions
A function represents a block of statements that together perform a specific task. Using functions, you can repeatedly call its block of statements as a whole in other parts of the program.

The function is declared as follows:

func function_name (parameter_list) (return_types) {
     executable_statements
}
 

Example function:


func main() {
  hello()
}

func hello() {
     fmt.Println("Hello World")
}

Important! The opening curly brace must be on the same line as the function declaration, otherwise you will get an error. This is done for a uniform code style.

As a reminder, short variable declarations (a := 5) only work inside functions.

 

Utilities: If you have Go installed on your computer, you can use the command line to study the documentation for a particular standard function. For example, if we want to know details about the Println() function we can enter the command:

go doc fmt.Println
or

go doc fmt Println
If you want to learn more about how the doc command works, you can enter the command:

go help doc
